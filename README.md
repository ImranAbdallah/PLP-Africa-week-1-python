Simple Python Calculator
This is a basic command-line calculator program written in Python. It's a great starting point for learning about user input and performing simple arithmetic operations.

How to Run the Program
Save the code: Make sure the Python code is saved in a file named something like calculator.py.

Open your terminal: Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.

Run the command: Execute the following command in your terminal:

python3 calculator.py

How It Works
The program will prompt you for three pieces of information:

The first number.

The second number.

The desired arithmetic operation (+, -, *, or /).

After you provide the input, the program will calculate and display the results for all four possible operations, making it easy for you to find the result you were looking for.

Example Usage
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): +

You chose the operation: '+'
Addition (10.0 + 5.0): 15.0
Minus (10.0 - 5.0): 5.0
Multiplication (10.0 * 5.0): 50.0
Division (10.0 / 5.0): 2.0
